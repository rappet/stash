# AS207968

My personal ASN. It only has one backbone router (running Bird2 on NixOS) currently and is mostly dead.
You can see it's connectivity on [bgp.tools](https://bgp.tools/as/207968).

## Peering

I will ignore peering requests currently. If you want to peer with me, use a route server instead.
Maybe I change my mind if I updated my config management for that.
